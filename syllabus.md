Tuesday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

Thursday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of
how populations and communities change through time and to provide fundamental 
concepts of how to forecast those changes. By the end of the semester, students will:

1)  Have an appreciation of the dynamics of species and communities.

2)  Understand the basic concepts of forecasting that apply across fields 
    and the challenges within ecology

3) Have a basic understanding of working with time series data

4) Be able to fit models to data and use those models to make forecasts

#### **General Course Structure and Expectations**

This course is a mixture class discussion of primary literature and hands-on
experience involving data and computing. Completing assigned readings,
intellectual engagement with topics, discussion participation, and completion of
assignments are the main ways students will learn in this class. Tuesdays are
typically concept discussion days. Thursdays will be a mix of tools or concept
discussion. You are expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned papers.

#### **Paper Discussion Participation**

There are two general approaches to participating in paper discussion.

The first is to attend class and partipate in the group discussion about the paper. This
discussion is generally centered around the discussion questions that are provided
in advance but may also expand beyond them. Our goal is to produce a classroom environment
where everyone is comfortable participating in class discussions. We will try to manage
discussions so that everyone has a chance to contribute and make sure that folks who are
less comfortable interjecting get a chance to participate. We welcome your help in making
sure that everyone in the class gets a chance to contribute.

If you can't or don't want to participate in conversations about papers in class you can
write up short answers to the provided discussion questions and send them to us each week.
You can choose to either have use read them ourselves and count them as participation or
let us know that you would like us to share those ideas for you by reading some of them in
class as we talk about relevant material.

#### **Course Grading**

* 50% of grade will be based on participation including discussing papers and participating in in-class tutorials
* 50% will be based on completion of assignments

#### **Attendance Policy**

Two days can be missed without impacts on your grade without the need
to submit make-up work, though we recommend that students attempt any 
missed class activities on their own time because additional class 
activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge. 

Additional missed days can be made-up by submitting make-up work.
Class activities can be made-up on the student's time by doing
the activity and submitting the code/data. Missed 
discussions can be made up by providing written responses to the discussion questions
on the readings for the day(s) missed. Two to three sentences per question
is an approximate guideline for the length of response to each question, but
feel free to write more or less as appropriate.

#### **Course Materials**

1) All reading materials are made available through the [course website](https://weecology.github.io/forecasting-dynamics-course/). If you are off campus you may need to use the VPN to access some of them.

2)  Laptops: On class activity days, laptops will be required for class.


### **UF Policies**

#### **University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities**

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register
with the Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean
of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must
then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting
assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not
retroactive, therefore, students should contact the office as soon as
possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.

#### **University Policy on Academic Misconduct**

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student
Honor Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.

#### **Netiquette and Communication Courtesy**

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common courtesy
in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.
