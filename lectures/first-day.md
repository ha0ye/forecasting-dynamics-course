# Introductions

* Instructors
* Goals for the class
    * Forecasting is increasingly important
	* Difficult
	* Ecology hasn't historically done this well
	* Need to study dynamics in order to understand this
	* Need to learn how to work with dynamic data
	* Learn from other fields dealing with similar problems
* Students
    * What do you hope to get out of the class
	
# How the course will run

* Mix of paper discussion & R tutorials
* Discussion
    * Read paper in advance
    * Questions to think about provided to help guide thinking while reading
* R tutorials
    * Introductions to methods for working with dynamic data and forecasting
	* I do, we do, you do
	* We will demonstrate a concept, have you follow along on your computers,
      and then have you do something very similar in class
  * There will then be an assignment to do something very similar on your own
* Grades
  * 50% participation
	  * Participating in paper discussions in class
	  * If you're worried that you aren't able to participate sufficiently let us know
	  * Participating in R tutorials
  * 50% assignments
    * 5 assignments using R to work with data and make forecasts

# Opening discussion

* Do we think we can forecast successfully in ecology?
