### Thinking about ecological data available for forecasting

* Brainstorm: What properties would ideal data for studying ecological dynamics and making forecasts have?
    * Long time-series
    * Continuous
    * High resolution
    * Broad spatial replication

* Brainstorm: what types of data for we have for studying dynamics & making forecasts?
    * Talk about each type as it is brought up
    * Give or ask for examples of each data type as it is brought up
    * Write them down on the board in a horizontal line from "further back in
      time/easier" to "more recent/more difficult". Spatial only data will come
      up, write it in a separate (off on one end) section with a "spatial only"
      label.
  
    `Resurvey -> Idiosyncratic -> Continuous w/Gaps -> Continuous`

* Ask what types of data are easier/harder to collect
* Ask what types are more common for going further back in time vs. more recent
* Draw these gradients on board

* How long do you think most ecological studies/time-series are?
* Show: [Recent study by Estes et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0524-4/figures/1)

### Sources of ecological time-series data

* Brainstorm: Specific sources for ecological time-series data
* *Bring over any sources from prior discussion and ask what the datasets in a group have in common*
* *As dataset for new group is suggested discuss the type of data and start a new column on board*

* Community science data
    * BBS
* Compilations
    * GPDB
    * PBDB/Neotoma
    * BioTime
* Long-term monitoring
    * NEON
    * LTERs
    * STRI Big Plots
    * Fisheries
* "Single Investigator"
    * Ecological Archives - Portal, Adler, Goheen, Clarks

### What kind of data would you use?

* If you wanted to make a forecast for something you are interested in what do you think the most readily available type of data would be and do you know any specific examples?

### Where to find time-series data (*if students ask*)

* Ecological Archives
* LTER Databank
* DataOne
* Ecological Data Wiki
* Google Data Search
