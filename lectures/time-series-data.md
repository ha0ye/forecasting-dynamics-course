### Thinking about ecological data available for forecasting

* Ask group to brain storm types of data suitable for ecological forecasting
* Talk about each type as it is brought up
* Give or ask for examples of each data type as it is brought up
* Write them down on the board in a horizontal line from "further back in
  time/easier" to "more recent/more difficult"
  
`Resurvey -> Idiosyncratic -> Continuous w/Gaps -> Continuous`

* Ask what types of data are easier/harder to collect
* Ask what types are more common for going further back in time vs. more recent
* Draw these gradients on board

* How long do you think most ecological studies/time-series are?
* Show [Recent study by Estes et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0524-4/figures/1)

* If you wanted to make a forecast for something you are interested in what do you think the most readily available type of data would be and do you know any specific examples?
