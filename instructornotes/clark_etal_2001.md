### What is forecastable?

> In what ways is uncertainty important for forecasting?

* Need to know how accurate the forecast is for planning
* Tells us about how much information is contained in the associated model
*  

> What does "inherent uncertainty" mean and how might it limit the
  forecastability of ecological systems?

> What are "slow variables" and what promise do they hold for ecological
  forecasting?

> What are some of the problems if a forecast doesn't handle uncertainty
  properly?

### Data from experiments and monitoring

> What are the kinds of data that may be important for forecasting?

### Forecasts in decision making

> What does the zebra mussel example tell us about forecasts and how they may or
  may not influence policy?

> What is "bet-hedging" and why might it be important for ecological forecasts?

> What are "scenarios" and why might they be useful?

### Next steps

> What is your impression of how the "next steps" discussed here have been
  implemented in the last 15 years?

> What should the nexts steps be for the next 15 years?

### Start with dynamics

* The title of this course is Ecological Dynamics and Forecasting
* That's because if we want to be able to forecast the future we need to
  understand how ecological systems change through time
* We will start by spending several weeks learning about
    * Key aspects of ecological dynamics
    * How to find and analyze time-series data
* Then we will move on to using these concepts, data, and tools for thinking
  about and making forecasts
