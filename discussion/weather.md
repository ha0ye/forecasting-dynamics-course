* What are the different types of forecast models (i.e. the different modelling approaches) used to forecast hurricanes?
* What are the pros and cons of these different model types?
* Spend some time on the descriptions of dynamical models (aka numerical weather prediction) because we're going to spend some time talking about this approach to forecasting in particular.
    * How does numerical weather prediction create its forecasts? What are the models based on?
    * Where does the uncertainty in the forecasts come from?
    * Why do we need to fly airplanes through hurricanes?
* The page on dynamical models lists four different global dynamical models that are used in the US hurricane forecasting. Given your reading of "How Hurricane Forecast Models Work" what do you think some of the differents are among these models?
* What is an ensemble model and why is it useful> What do you think is an important piece of information that you would want from an ensemble forecast?
* If we tried to build a numerical weather prediction-type model for ecology, what type sof things would we want to put into it?
* Do you think numerical weather prediction is a good approach for ecological forecasting? Why or why not?
    * What issues might we have with applying this approach? Can we overcome them?
