### Species Distribution Model Questions
* Define SDM’s. What data is required to create SDMs?
* What are benefits of accurate SDMs?
* Are there some situations where SDM’s are more informative or useful than others? 
* Do you think habitat data is enough to predict accurate SDM’s? What other habitat data might be useful for SDM’s that cannot be gathered from satellite imagery?
* Do you think that local or global SDM’s are more accurate? What is the benefit of conducting a SDM on a global scale?
* What is the problem with analysts unconsciously imposing spatial scales by data choice or model structure?
* Some studies on SDM’s only look at geographic data and ignore environmental data. When is this dangerous? When might this be acceptable?
* How is easily gathered data from satellite imagery and weather station data beneficial to SDM’s? How can critizen science data be beneficial to SDM’s? What is the danger in using citizen science data? 
* How can a strong knowledge of a study system and species inform better SDM’s?
* Researchers can add as many predictor variables as they want into a SDM. Why might this cause problems?
* Do you think using SDM’s to determine new sites in the current species’ range are generally more accurate than predicating areas outside current range? Why might we want to know of unoccupied sites in current species range? Why do we want to predict areas of species distribution outside of their current range?
* How well do you think species distribution models will perform as climate change progresses?
* What are the problems with predicting species distribution in non-equilibrium settings? What is the danger in completely excluding non-equilibrium data from SDM’s? What can we do to improve models for extrapolation in non-equilibrium settings? 
* We know that more data is typically equivalent to better models, but in some cases, without quality control, more data can mislead species distribution models. Give examples of data collection processes that may produce questionable models. Are there situations where including questionable data in SDM’s shows convincing but maybe not accurate species distribution models?
* What are some concerns with modeling rare species? Do you think it is possible to get informative SDMs from few data points?
* SDM’s can be modeled for the past. Give an example of one reason why scientists would want to model distribution in the past? Do you think this is easier or more difficult than modeling into the future?
* What is a realized niche? How does this present challenges for modeling SDMs? Inclusion of biotic factors in SDMs may reduce these problems, but do you think researchers can determine all significant biotic factors of species distributions?
* What unique challenges are presented when using presence-absence data?
* Why is it important for researchers to outline uncertainty? In your opinion is it better to over or underestimate SDM’s?
* What are your overall thoughts on SDM’s? Should they be used to inform decision making?
