1. Think about the Dornelas et al paper (biodiversity change through time). What pattern in change in species composition did they show? You probably made an assumption about how that change occurred: was it through small gradual changes over time or in larger rapid shifts in composition? Why was that your assumption?
2. Why might rapid ecological transitions be difficult to study or forecast?
3. How might the commoness or rarity of rapid events impact how we model community dynamics?
4. If rapid events are triggered by extreme climate events, what does this mean for forecasting community dynamics under climate change?
5. What kind of data would be useful for determining the prevalence of rapid transitions in nature?
