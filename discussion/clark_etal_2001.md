### What is forecastable?

* In what ways is uncertainty important for forecasting?
* What does "inherent uncertainty" mean and how might it limit the
  forecastability of ecological systems?
* What are "slow variables" and what promise do they hold for ecological
  forecasting?
* What are some of the problems if a forecast doesn't handle uncertainty
  properly?

### Data from experiments and monitoring

* What are the kinds of data that may be important for forecasting?

### Forecasts in decision making

* What does the zebra mussel example tell us about forecasts and how they may or
  may not influence policy?
* What is "bet-hedging" and why might it be important for ecological forecasts?
* What are "scenarios" and why might they be useful?

### Next steps

* What is your impression of how the "next steps" discussed here have been
  implemented in the last 15 years?
* What should the next steps be for the next 15 years?
