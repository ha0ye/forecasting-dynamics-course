### TRADITIONAL MODELERS TOOLBOX

**Deterministic:** Initial state and inputs (parameter values) completely determine the behavior of our model, process, etc. Yields a single solution appropriate to input.

**Probabilistic:** Distribution of all possible outcomes of a process, model, etc. Yields multiple values.

* Think of 2-3 examples in which we estimate that a system stabilizes after being perturbed.
* Imagine we are interested in forecasting if we would need to protect the species Forecastus floridensi. Would we be more interested in knowing at what stage its population reaches equilibrium or its current population trajectory?
* Why does a probabilistic approach help us more in forecasting than a deterministic approach? 

### SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY

**Uncertainty:** Unknowns of a process, our imperfect understanding of it. Decreases with sample size.

**Sources of variability:**  Variation in process itself that our model does not capture. With a higher sample size these sources of variability are better characterized but do not decrease.

* Give a detailed example of both in your system of study.

#### OBSERVATION ERROR

**Observation error:**  Uncertainty with which we observe a process.

* Give examples of events that can increase noise in measurements. 
* Can observation error be biased?
* Why would we have zero uncertainty if observation error was the only source of uncertainty?

#### PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY

**Parameter:** Slope or change in the mean of *y* for a ONE unit increase in *x*.

**Parameter uncertainty:**  Uncertainty in true values of coefficients of models.

* Which are two examples of parameter uncertainty ecologist are most familiar with?
* Why would  intercept uncertainty yield a band shape CI and a slope uncertainty yield a triangle shaped CI?


#### INITIAL CONDITIONS

**State variables:** Properties we can attribute. Are used to describe  a mathematical state of a dynamic system. They give a snapshot of the system properties at any given time. 


**Initial conditions:** Specific starting values of system state variables

* What is uncertainty  in initial conditions  and why is it relevant for forecasting?
* Can uncertainty in initial conditions be reduced easily with an increase in sample size?

#### PROCESS ERROR

**Process error**: Encompasses all sources of true variability uncounted by our model. It affects underlying model dynamics.

* How can you think of process error with respect to residual error?  
 
### MODEL CHOICE

* What is model selection?
* Can the model with the lowest AIC score still be a poor model?

### THINKING PROBABILISTICLY

* Label each of the white boxes in figure 2.7 with the name of the uncertainty source.
* Are these model parameters constants?
* Why can we not tell a priori which of these parameters and uncertainties has the largest impact on forecast uncertainty?

### PREDICTABILITY

**Poor imagination syndrome (PIS):** Not thinking of low probability events that can have substantial impacts on a system and affect our forecasting. 

* Think of a low probability event in your system of study that might drive big changes.

* What impact might PIS have in forecasting results?

#### BARRIERS IN FORECASTING

* Why are chaotic systems (systems very sensitive to changes in initial conditions) limited to predictability through long time periods. 

* Why is computational irreducibility (not being able to approximate complex system with a simple model) an issue in forecasting?

* Why can poor understanding of an ecological system lead to worse forecasting models in this big data era?

#### WEATHER FORECASTING

* How could forecasting, even with uncertainty, aid in our understanding of causal relationships?

* Why should ecologist not wait to forecast until forecasting is more accurate or our understanding of the system is better?

#### ECOFORECASTING PROBLEM

* What can contributed to higher predictability?
* If we know that $X_1$ is the best predictor of Y, why might we opt to use $X_2$ to predict Y?
* Which types of uncertainty/variability do you think are most important in ecological systems?
* Can a forecast model be useful even if it does not include all of these sources of variance?
