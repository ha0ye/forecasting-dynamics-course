Population models for projections

* What is a population model? What information is needed for it? What information does it provide?
* Any thoughts on their implementation of a population model here? 
* What advantages could population models have over SDMs in projecting habitat suitability?
* How was the model built (ie. what were the components, input) and what assumptions were made?

Applying population models to large scales introduces unique challenges

* How was sampling/measurement of occurrence and abundance achieved and what issues may there be in doing so?
* What is the problem with incorporating spatial autocorrelation in population models over a large area, and how can this problem be addressed?
* Anything else you can think of?

Implementing the model

* How were "equilibrium population states" simulated and used?
* How were temporal simulations performed and how do they relate or differ from the equilibrium populations?
* In what ways did the model succeed or underperform?
* What role did including spatial random effect provide?

Using population models for forecasting

* In what ways may the model be improved? What are the tradeoffs? Besides this model, are there any other general improvements or potential tradeoffs you can think of for building such a model?
* In what ways did the outcome of this population model approach differ from SDM or other projections?
* Whether for this system, or in general, what are some things to consider in developing such a model and acquiring data for it? How may these things change given the specific questions that are asked and the specific system?
