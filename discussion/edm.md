 * Briefly, what is Empirical Dynamic Modeling, and how is it different from Parametric Modeling?

 * Why is the EDM approach more useful than traditional Parametric Models? Ye et al. argue that there are at least three problems with using Parametric Models in ecology, listed below. Do you think that these are generally true in ecology? 

        I. Model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time.
        II. Models may fit well to existing data but lack out of sample predictive skill.
        III. Key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems.

* How does EDM solve these problems?
* Why is the Fraser River Sockeye Salmon fishery useful for competing the EDM approach against Parametric Models?
* What is the Ricker spawner-recruit model? What are the important parameters, what data are needed to estimate these parameters, and what is the output?
* How do Ye et al. compare the forecasts of the Ricker model with EDM models? 
* The EDM gave better predictions (higher forecast accuracy) than the Ricker model after accounting for environmental factors (e.g., temperature). What does this suggest about the Ricker model (our mechanistic hypothesis for the system)? Can EDM help us infer the causal links among variables?
* Ye et al. test the EDM for population dynamics, but over the semester weâ€™ve talked about the dynamics of several features of ecological or environmental systems, including biodiversity (Dornelas et al. 2014), species distributions (Parmesan et al. 1999), phenology (Cleland 2007), and hurricanes (last week). Do you think there is potential for the EDM approach in these other areas?
